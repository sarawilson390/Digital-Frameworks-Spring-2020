Copied the spreadsheet to another sheet so I had a copy of the original.

COLUMN: TITLE
1. Standardized any reporting job language to “Reporter”
2. I decided that Staff Writer is a reporting job, so those cells were also changed to Reporter
3. Standardized Editor in Chief job language to “Editor-in-Chief”
4. Any copy editing job to “Copy Editor”
5. Any other editor job to “Editor”  (Note: Editor doesn’t look like a real word at this point)
6. Any producing job to “Producer”
7. Any other job title I cleaned up to be a clean, capitalized title. I decided this was better than lumping a bunch of jobs into a “Miscellaneous” category
- e.g. Content strategist to “Content Strategist”

COLUMN: COMPANY
1. Next, I had to decide what to do with company names. There are a whole bunch of descriptions (“A Detroit daily newspaper”). I took the ones that indicated which company they work for and standardized that company name. I deleted the rest with vague descriptions of the company.
- A McClatchy daily to “McClatchy”
- A Future PLC web outlet to “Future PLC”
- A Future PLC web page to “Future PLC”
- A Gatehouse daily to “Gatehouse”
2. Standardized “ABC News”
3. Standardized “Adams Publishing Group”
4. Standardized “Advance”
5. Lumped all Al Jazeera channels to “Al Jazeera”
6. Standardized “Alt Weekly”
7. Standardized “amNewYork”
8. Standardized “Atlanta Journal-Constitution”

COLUMN: SALARY:
1. Standardized salary to $123,456.78 (selected the entire column and formatted as currency)
2. Added a “Bonus” column, formatted as currency
3. Added a “Hourly Wage” column, formatted as currency. If it was a weekly wage, I divided that by 40 hours per week.
4. Took out inconsistencies in salary (Row 60 had a salary of -$1,000,000)

COLUMN: GENDER/ETHNICITY/IDENTITY
1. Split the Gender/Ethnicity/Identity to three columns: Gender, Ethnicity, Gender Adjective
2. Female to “F”
3. Male to “M”
4. Nonbinary to “NB”
5. “White”
6. “POC”
7. “Black”
8. “Cis”
9. “Latinx”
10. “Asian”
11. “Biracial”

COLUMN: YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
1. Standardized Years of Experience to just numerals

COLUMN: LOCATION
1. Split location to two columns: City and State 
2. Took out regional descriptors

I decided to leave the job duties and previous experience columns as reference points if I ever needed them.
