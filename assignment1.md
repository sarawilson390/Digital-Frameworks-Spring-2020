# Digital Frameworks: Assignment 1
## Story Idea 1: Who has the most to lose in a 2020 Census undercount?
COVID-19 is shaping up to be the biggest story of this year, perhaps even this decade. There is a lot to cover, however, regarding the 2020 Census. I wrote a piece earlier this year about how the move to an online enumeration could affect traditonally hard to count populations, and I have wanted to continue that reporting. People of color are historically undercounted and people are increasingly aware of that, but how have various demographics approached the census over the decades? What did the HTC population look like in 1890, and how does that inform how we should engage similar populations now? The most interesting layer in this year's census is its potential impact of the Latinx population and the residual fear over a citizenship question. Experts pretty widely agree that this fear will decrease Latinx participation. 

### [Critique 1: The Evolution of the American Census](https://pudding.cool/2020/03/census-history/)
#### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* This is definintely more of a story where the reader chooses their own experience. I filtered the data with the "Race, Ethnicity and Slavery" option and the takeaway seemed to be that the census got increasingly more nuanced in its questioning over the years. I'd give it a 3. 
   * The point of the graphic timeline was to illustrate how census questions illustrated a diversifying and evolving America.
   * No.
* It was very intuitive to navigate the data. Each circle represented a question, a hover brought up what the question was. It scrolled like a normal timeline.
   * Yes. 
   * The color-coded question type categories should have moved with the timeline. It was easy to forget.
* It was 5/5 correct. Each question type had the direct source photo of the census question.
   * No areas to improve accuracy.
   * They could check with experts in each of the fields they stratified the data in: race, immigration, housing, etc.
   * They provided both first and secondary sources.
   * Everything was explained well. 

#### Objective: Quality

* This was executed with impeccable quality. 
   * There is enough information for context but not enough to overwhelm visually. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * It did a great job organizing the data in a cohesive timeline and correlating it to historical events e.g. Missori Compromise, Seneca Falls, etc.
   * It took work from the reader to compare data points across categories e.g. how economic questions increased along with racial questions.

#### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* The graphic used color and type extremely well. It categorized question type by color and that helped organize a complicated set of information.
* Type: 5
   * It used the same serif font for everything, and varied the size of the type according to importance.
*Color: 5
   * Like I mentioned, the color coordination lent consistency and understanding. 
   
#### Objective: Creativity

* This was extremely creative. Timelines can be so boring, but the design elements and additional information made this exceptional.
   * It was a 4/5 in effectiveness.
