# Digital Frameworks: Assignment 1
## Story Idea 1: Who has the most to lose in a 2020 Census undercount?
COVID-19 is shaping up to be the biggest story of this year, perhaps even this decade. There is a lot to cover, however, regarding the 2020 Census. I wrote a piece earlier this year about how the move to an online enumeration could affect traditonally hard to count populations, and I have wanted to continue that reporting. People of color are historically undercounted and people are increasingly aware of that, but how have various demographics approached the census over the decades? What did the HTC population look like in 1890, and how does that inform how we should engage similar populations now? The most interesting layer in this year's census is its potential impact of the Latinx population and the residual fear over a citizenship question. Experts pretty widely agree that this fear will decrease Latinx participation. 

### [Critique 1: The Evolution of the American Census](https://pudding.cool/2020/03/census-history/)
#### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* This is definintely more of a story where the reader chooses their own experience. I filtered the data with the "Race, Ethnicity and Slavery" option and the takeaway seemed to be that the census got increasingly more nuanced in its questioning over the years. I'd give it a 3. 
   * The point of the graphic timeline was to illustrate how census questions illustrated a diversifying and evolving America.
   * No.
* It was very intuitive to navigate the data. Each circle represented a question, a hover brought up what the question was. It scrolled like a normal timeline.
   * Yes. 
   * The color-coded question type categories should have moved with the timeline. It was easy to forget.
* It was 5/5 correct. Each question type had the direct source photo of the census question.
   * No areas to improve accuracy.
   * They could check with experts in each of the fields they stratified the data in: race, immigration, housing, etc.
   * They provided both first and secondary sources.
   * Everything was explained well. 

#### Objective: Quality

* This was executed with impeccable quality. 
   * There is enough information for context but not enough to overwhelm visually. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * It did a great job organizing the data in a cohesive timeline and correlating it to historical events e.g. Missori Compromise, Seneca Falls, etc.
   * It took work from the reader to compare data points across categories e.g. how economic questions increased along with racial questions.

#### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* The graphic used color and type extremely well. It categorized question type by color and that helped organize a complicated set of information.
* Type: 5
   * It used the same serif font for everything, and varied the size of the type according to importance.
*Color: 5
   * Like I mentioned, the color coordination lent consistency and understanding. 
   
#### Objective: Creativity

* This was extremely creative. Timelines can be so boring, but the design elements and additional information made this exceptional.
   * It was a 4/5 in effectiveness. 
   
## Story Idea 2: How do rural hospital closures affect COVID cases?
One of the most impactful healthcare stories in the past decade is the closure of rural hospitals. I am interested in how this intersects with the COVID-19 pandemic. What does a rural county do when they don't have a single hospital? The Black Belt, a string of poor, underserved counties in the South would be a good entry point in this. Alabama had nearly 20 hospital closures from 2010-2017. How are those communities faring now in this public health crisis? Where did the burden fall without a hospital? Is it impacting the ability hospitals in metropolitan areas to take care of their own caseloads?

### [Critique 2: Coronavirus Was Slow to Spread to Rural America. Not Anymore.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/08/us/coronavirus-rural-america-cases.html)
#### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* As the reader scrolled, the map of America updated to show the spread of coronavirus in rural America. It clearly communicated the point that COVID has spread throughout rural counties and they are not immune to the pandemic. 4/5 
   * The point was to show the number of confirmed cases in each rural county. 
   * That thesis point was in the headline.
* It was also very intuitive to navigate this data. The map updated as you scrolled with coordinating text, and then the graphic stayed static before the main article started. 5/5
   * Yes. Scrolling was the most efficient. 
   * It would be cool to have tool tips over the counties, to hover over and see the number of cases.
* The data was based on "data from state and local health agencies, hospitals and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention." As much as we can trust these sources is as much as we can trust the accuracy. 4/5
   * I might question the accuracy in states with slow responses, like Alabama. Where did tests slowly arrive? That could impact accuracy. 
   * I'm not sure what other experts to check with besides local governments and hospitals. Those are the record keepers of the area. 
   * They provided sources at the very bottom of the article. 
   * Everything was explained well. 

#### Objective: Quality

* They used an orange gradient to express number of cases. 
   * It's a simple map with a key, so it looks like it goes together. 
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * The color was a great way for the reader to compare county by county the number of cases. A dark orange county next to a light orange or gray county raised natural questions about the case disparity. 

#### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Again, the orange gradient was an effective way to communicate case number severity. 
* Type: 5
   * It used a simple sans serif to label states, with a white stroke for readability.
* Color: 5 
   
#### Objective: Creativity

* This was a creative presentation of data. Heat maps are effective and intuitive. 
   * It was a 5/5 in effectiveness.
