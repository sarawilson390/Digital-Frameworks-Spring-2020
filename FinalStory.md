WASHINGTON — Male journalists were nearly twice as likely to get called on during White House Coronavirus Task Force press briefings, highlighting a persistent gender bias at news conferences during the current presidential administration.

USA Today correspondent Courtney Subramanian said she notices a clear gender bias during conferences when President Donald Trump is the one calling on reporters.

“It can be incredibly frustrating,” she said of the discrepancy.

During the 39 briefings held between March 13 and April 27, White House correspondents asked over 1,000 questions to Trump, Dr. Barbara Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci and other government officials on the task force. That number includes initial questions and any answered follow-up questions.

Despite there often being a near-equal number of male and female correspondents in the briefing room, women asked just 36 percent of the questions. Not only were they less likely to get called on, they were also less likely to get a follow-up question answered.

On March 16, for example, there were 24 journalists present: 12 men and 12 women. But during the 54-minute briefing, male reporters asked 22 questions, while female reporters only landed 12. 

Some days were more extreme. During the 103-minute briefing on April 4, men asked 32 out of the 39 questions — an 82 percent share. On April 9, women did not ask a single question. 

Between March and April, there were only five briefings where women asked more questions than their male colleagues. 

The discrepancy in questions asked by men and women during these coronavirus briefings could indicate a gender bias on who Trump calls on during press conferences, according to experts and current correspondents. Trump led every briefing in March and April before Kayleigh McEnany took over as press secretary. 

The briefing room is set up to give priority to wire and television reporters who sit in the front row, who are often male journalists Trump “feels comfortable with,” according to Subramanian. Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason and Fox News correspondent John Roberts sit in the front row and often get one of the first questions during briefings.

“The president will call on people that he recognizes and he's familiar with, and John Roberts is a good example of that, where he'll have quite a few back and forths with him,” said Politico correspondent Meridith McGraw. 

McGraw began covering the White House last November. She’s learned since then how important it is to get Trump’s attention in the briefing room in order to get called on — catching his eye while someone else is speaking and smiling to signal friendliness rather than combativeness. A reporter is more likely to get called on if they catch Trump’s attention early on, she said. 

**The Press Corps as A Boys-Only Club**

The White House press corps was completely male until the 1960s, when wire service reporter Helen Thomas joined, according to Dr. Lindsey Meeks, an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma who studies gender and the media. Thomas, whose “sharp questions from the front row of the White House press room challenged and annoyed 10 presidents” according to her obituary in the Washington Post, wrote for United Press International for almost 60 years.

Even as more women entered the journalism profession in the 1970s, they were overwhelmingly assigned to lifestyle beats such as beauty and health, not to the coveted White House post. 

“We see a cultural lag effect, where women start getting introduced within the newsrooms, but then there’s certainly a lag before they are seen as actually a credible journalist who might be assigned hard news, prestigious positions,” Meeks said.

Meeks found similar results of bias when she researched the gender breakdown of called-upon reporters in White House briefings between 1969 and 2016. She said there’s not a tremendous fluctuation in the rate different presidents called on men versus women, consistently hovering in the 30 to 40 percent range. 

**Trump’s Skirmishes With Women in the Media**

Trump’s consistent and visible clashes with the media, and in particular female reporters, have been a defining feature of his presidency. 

“This is a president who has a record with women,” Subramanian said. “In general, he can be pretty combative with female WHC. There are a couple who he regularly sort of tussles with.”

One of the  reporters who Trump regularly clashes with is PBC correspondent Yamiche Alcindor. On March 13, when Alcindor asked about the White House’s slow response to the pandemic, Trump called it a “nasty question.” The president again shut down Alcindor’s question on March 29 about statements he made on The Sean Hannity Show.

“Why don’t you people — why don’t you act in a little more positive? It’s always ‘get ya, get ya, get ya.’ And you know what? That’s why nobody trusts the media anymore,” he said.

As Alcindor, a black woman, tried to finish her question, Trump continued: “Look, let me tell you something. Be nice. Don’t be threatening. Be nice.” 

Alcindor responded to the incident in a tweet.

“I’m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job,” she wrote. “My take: Be steady. Stay focused. Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.”

Her words echo other advice from female reporters covering all beats who believe maintaining professionalism is key. Research from UCLA professor Steve Clayman shows that women journalists often adapt more aggressive, adversarial tones in their work, and Meeks said she observes that on a daily basis in her own research. 

“When women have to enter some of these more masculinized fields, they have to take on some of the more masculine speaking styles to prove themselves worthy of being in a space,” Meeks said. “I think that women kind of thread that line when it comes to journalism by being extremely professional.”

Trump’s attacks on female journalists, however, seem to toe an ideological line. Chanel Rion, the correspondent for conservative-learning outlet One America News Network, is rarely the focus of the president’s criticism of the media. In fact, she often gets called on whenever she is in the briefing room, perhaps an exception to the norm.

“You always have to look at how gender intersects with outlet,” Meeks said. “He certainly treats women correspondents from conservative outlets differently than he does those from more liberal leaning or perceived to be liberal outlets. That can play a lot of different things in terms of how journalists approach that space.”

At the end of the day, journalists enter the James S. Brady Presidential Briefing Room to do a job: question power and report the news. The Trump administration may require a bit more professional gymnastics to accomplish that goal.

McGraw said it’s important to go in with “really short, clear questions that you’ll know he will be able to answer.”

“It does require you to come ready for battle,” she said. “Most of that is being able to confidently ask your question.” 

Subramanian also said that heading into the briefing room can feel “a bit like putting on your armor.” She said it’s crucial for her to have well-researched questions in advance and to be persistent in the question she needs answered. 

In one briefing, Trump began talking over Subramanian to correct her pronunciation of New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s name. She said that even though it felt demeaning, she had to make the calculation of what was more important: engage in the tension or continue her question. She chose the latter.

“In the moment, I knew it was such a minor detail,” she said. “It was a way for him to assert power over another female.”
