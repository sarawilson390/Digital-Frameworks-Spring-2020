**Christy Smith receives more individual donations in CA-25 race**

Despite receiving less than half the number of individual donations than his opponent, Mike Garcia was victorious in the special election in California’s 25th congressional district on May 12. 

Republican Mike Garcia for Congress raised $1.5 million with 2,419 donations in the special election to replace ousted Rep. Katie Hill. His opponent, Democrat Christy Smith, raised $2.9 million with 5,856 donations. Both candidates received about half of their donations from out of state, notably from their party’s fundraising platforms Win Red and Act Blue.
