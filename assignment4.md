I plan to expand on assignment 3, where I started a database considering the length of Trump's COVID-19 press conferences and the number of reporter questions answered. I want to add a gender axis to that: how many times does he call on female reporters, versus male ones? Female journalists such as Yamiche Alcindor, Paula Reid, and Kaitlan Collins have all been subject to incredbily snarky comments from the president. 

To do this, I will make my own data set using the same method I used last week: using CSPAN footage and official White House transcripts. I will count the number of questions asked by female journalists and the ones asked by male journalists. Ideally, I would gather data from every single press conference. If time becomes too much of an issue, however, I will focus on the month of April.

I'm imagining a timeline of sorts with stacked bar charts on each date â€” blue representing male questions and red representing female ones. I don't know how to incorporate the total length of the briefing on that vizualization, so maybe that will be an entirely separate graph. 

This is timely because the way Trump interacts with the press is a hallmark issue of his presidency. 

For sources, I will try to get into contact with those aforementioned reporters. Collins and I went to the same undergrad and have connected before. I will also speak with journalism experts at places like Media Matters or academic institutions.
