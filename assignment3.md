President Trump has been hosting near-daily Coronavirus Task Force press briefings. I am interested in the length of these conferences â€” have they gotten longer or shorter over time? Does the length correlate to any scandal or news event? I'd collect data points and put them on a chart that also includes a timeline of relevant events.
I will be collecting:
- date of press briefing
- length of briefing in minutes
- number of speakers
- number of reporter questions

I will collect the data using CSPAN footage and the official transcripts on the White House's website.
